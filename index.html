                        <p><span class="firstletter">W</span>riting only one line of codes and then deleting, without any idea of how to attract my audience suddenly, I repeatedly redesigned the wireframe of the website and put the image in a suitable place. The frustration fills me the whole week before I submit my capstone project for graduate.  The difficulties encountered in the thesis paper writing tested my professional knowledge and experimental strategy in programming. It also becomes the key direction and valuable experience in my future study.</p>
                        <p>Nowadays, web design is essential for any industry. Every company must have a web client. For several years in the past, I have experienced many setbacks and frustrations in the process of studying this subject. However, I have also experienced the joy, the illumination and the stimulation that it brought me with its rapid development and practical values. Thus, I firmly choose to my depth learning in this field at your esteemed program and believe I will continue to be fascinated by this subject with its endless secrets.</p>
                        <p>Making an option for a graduate specialty is just like making an option for the course of life. Dive into the most suitable for their taste of professional life is the greatest pleasure. Website Design and New Media major is a compound major integrating computer science, visual design, and new media knowledge. It covers three major areas that gallop at the fastest speed and throb synchronically with the pulses of the present-day society. As an interdisciplinary subject, it endeavors to investigate the efficacy of computer application in both visual design and user experience. My biggest advantage is that I have learned graphic designing and front end as well as programming and back end. This is in keeping with my innate quickness of thought and my close concern for cutting-edge information. To sum up, I know how to make it look nice, and how to make it work. What I need is more detailed and in-depth research on design. Since my undergraduate study only covered some aspects of graphic design, which made me feel that it was not enough, I wanted to learn more.</p>
