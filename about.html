                        <p>724 miles. 11 hours and 35 minutes. Heavy rain, tearful eyes, and blurred view. Hopelessness
                            with anxiety. All those digits, weather and emotion constituted my first long-distance
                            driving
                            alone from Chicago to Washington D.C. Up till now, I was still unwilling to recall this
                            rough memory, but this long journey now inspires me.</p>
                        <p>I interned in D.C. at China Global Television Network America during the summer of 2017. It
                            was the first time that I had nothing familiar. My first day in D.C. was filled with mental
                            stress. I lay on the bed, tried to ignore the real world and pretended I still stayed at
                            home with my close friends. However, I realized that I had not come here to waste time. I
                            was dragged to my workplace, and when I stepped into the TV station, I was aware that the
                            tension I expected was
                            nonexistent. My supervisor was kind and helpful, and I met my first friend in D.C.</p>
                        <p>Our group leader Rich Murphy was experienced and nice. He explained the TV station’s routine
                            patiently and kindly informed us that our major task was to work in WordPress and edit
                            videos from off-air for posting. Theoretically, the mission seemed easy to handle, but in
                            practice, it
                            was a total converse. Initially, I could hardly multi-task, and the assignment was
                            troublesome and stressful. Repeating the similar process everyday, I got used to it, and my
                            self-confidence kept increasing.</p>
                        <p>The daily duties gradually became less demanding and easier to cope with; nevertheless, the
                            real problem occurred during my off-time. In D.C, although I shared one house with some
                            others, I knew little about them. There was inadequate time to make friends, because the
                            workload was heavy. Fortunately, I discovered that one of my roommates was extroverted, and
                            we found we had a similar hobby of visiting museums.</p>
                        <p>As time elapsed, loneliness and anxiety were eventually eliminated. I became comfortable and
                            started enjoying my stay in D.C. As for my work, I moved to the next stage of devising my
                            own news ideas and creating stories. Although I didn’t shoot the clips, I had to find
                            sources which were valuable for both American and Chinese audiences. That was not easy, but
                            I implemented the idea pitching and researching skills I learned at school and made some
                            projects on topics that mattered.</p>
                        <p>Three months were much shorter than I had imagined before. I noticed that the biggest
                            challenge I met was not difficult work or unfamiliar circumstances but was my mindset and
                            attitude toward those challenges. Negative emotion would bring nothing but side effects to
                            both academic performance and daily life.</p>
                        <p>More than that, I understood that I needed people to listen to me while I was distressed. It
                            was incredible that I overcame all the barriers and obstacles, but thousands of foreigners
                            like me still need someone to hear their stories and feelings. Living in a strange community
                            is tough, and catching mainstream society’s attention to support foreigners is crucial.
                            Because my internship attracted me more to being a journalist and speaking for minorities,
                            it is my job to expose their stories to the public. Thus, reporting stories and be a voice
                            for foreigners are my goal.</p>
